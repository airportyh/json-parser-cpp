# JSON Parser in C++

This project implements a JSON Parser in recursive descent style.
Mainly it is used as a way for me to learn C++. Future plans are
to add a language that allows for easy transformation of JSON
files.

## Todo

* fix segfaults
* implement hex escape sequences to make it work with multi-byte characters
* separate the code into multiple files and organize in the C++ convensions
* pretty printer
* add transform language
    * parser
    * intepreter
